# lyver.no
This is the source for lyver.no (liar.TLD), a Norwegian goof site.
The reason why this site exists is cause I had a friend who constantly used the argument, "but I read it on teh interwebz".
So in the early stage I had a static HTML site just saying she was lying and used that as a counter argument.
After some years I decided to take to the next level and I purchased lyver.no and made it so that it reads the $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"].

It supports IDNA.
It requires a wildcard DNS record.
It uses the Simple-vhost module for lighttpd.

I'm available for more information on Freenode, contact weq if anything.
